# Momentum Tech Task

An important data point for many of the companies we work with is are they currently using a competitor.

One of the companies more specifically wants to know is a company using Drift live chat or Salesforce Live Agent chat.

In the project you'll find a `data` folder which contains homepages of various companies, some use Drift, some use Salesforce Live Agent some have not chat.

There is a draft endpoint here `/chat/find`, please complete the endpoint to return an array of all the companies with a field specifying which chat they are using.

Be aware that depending on how the website has installed Drift or Salesforce Live Agent the details you're looking for could be different.

Feel free to add any packages you need to the project.
